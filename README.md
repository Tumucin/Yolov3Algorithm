# Yolov3Algorithm

This model detects the defined object and draws bounding box, if the defined object exists in an image.
You can check the defined object in coco file.

You can find the original source code:

This source code based on YOLOv3-608 model. 

To execute the program, YOLOv3-608 models weigths are needed to download. 
You can download the weigths using this link:
https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
And you need to save it as yolov3.weights
